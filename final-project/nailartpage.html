      Nail Art can take a lot of practice and be difficult for beginners, but luckily there are a few tricks that may help:

            Nail Vinyls:
          </p>
          <p>
            Nail Vinyls are like stickers that can be placed on a nail (make sure it's over a fully dried top coat) and used as stencils. You can paint over them and then peel them off of the nail while the polish is still wet to get perfect shapes and designs. They come in a wide variety of shapes and patterns, like spirals, shape cutouts, and guides for french tips.

            Liquid Latex Products:
          </p>
          <p>
            Liquid latex is used in nail art to avoid getting polish on the skin around the nail. It is especially helpful while doing a gradient with a sponge (you can't help dabbing the polish onto the skin while getting the edges of the nail), water marbling (the latex easily gets rid of polish from skin after dipping your finger into it), or if you are just very messy when it comes to applying nail polish. You can use it by simply painting it on the skin you would like to protect from nail polish and letting it dry. After you are done painting, peel off the liquid latex from your skin, and you will see that any polish that didn't make it onto the nail has been easily removed from the surrounding skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            DO NOT USE THIS METHOD IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO LATEX!

            Using Acrylic Paint:
          </p>
          <p>
            Using acrylic paint on nails may sound a little bit strange, but it helps when trying to correct mistakes made when painting. It should not be used for the actual base color of the nail, but is helpful when used for the art on top. Apply a top coat (one that dries quickly is best) to the nail on top of the base color, and let it dry COMPLETELY (at least 20-30 minutes is ideal) before using the paint. Use the acrylic paint as if it were regular nail polish and paint on a design. The only thing that is different about using acrylic paint is that when you make a mistake, you can scratch that paint off with a toothpick so that you don't have to redo the entire nail. MAKE SURE to apply a top coat to nails that have acrylic paint on them, or else it will come off when you wash your hands.
