      <h2>Shaping the Nail</h2>
      <img src = /images/NailShapes.png>
      <p>
        There are many different shapes and lengths that you can make your nails. To file your nail, move the file quickly from one edge of the nail to the center. Do not move the file in the opposite direction, as it puts too much pressure on the nail bed, especially on long nails. DO NOT file your nails in a sawing motion; many people mistakenly do this because some nail professionals move the file so quickly that it appears they are moving it back and forth. This is not what is happening. Instead, after each movement of the file from the edge to the center of the nail, lift the file from the nail and position it back at the edge of the nail to begin a new movement of the file.

      <h2>Applying Nail Polish</h2>

      <p>
        The first step to easily, evenly applying nail polish is to use only one drop of nail polish on the tip of the brush. To do so, open the bottle of polish and wipe one side of the brush on the bottle's rim. Then, wipe half of the other side of the brush on the rim to allow only one drop of nail polish to remain on the surface of the brush. The drop should be on only one side of only the tip of the brush. To apply the polish, start a stroke just underneath the cuticle at the bottom of the nail, and continue the stroke to the tip. To fill in the redst of the nail, on each side of the first stroke, create a new stroke that goes from the bottom of the nail to the tip of the nail like the first stroke, but curve these new ones to follow the shape of the cuticle.
