        What is a Holographic Polish?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A "holo" nail polish, or holographic nail polish, contains glitter that reflects the entire color spectrum. The polish may have different color tints, and many of those tints have different saturations, but they should all still reflect every color of the rainbow in order to be considered holographic.  The following are all holographic, despite their different tints:

        Silver
      </p>
      <br>
      <img src = "https://ivpizzi.github.io/images/BlackHolo.png" width="282px" height="282px" class = "imagemargin">
      <p class = "floatleft">
        Black tint
      </p>
      <br>
      <img src = "https://ivpizzi.github.io/images/OrangeHolo.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" class = "imagemargin">
      <p class = "floatleft">
        Orange tint
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a lot of confusion as to what really is holographic and what can be classified as other things instead, like multi or dual chrome, iridescent, pearlescent, etc. These kinds of polishes do shift between colors, but not the whole rainbow. The following are NOT holographic:

      <p  class = "floatleft">
        Dual chrome
      </p>
      <img src = "https://ivpizzi.github.io/images/DualChrome.jpg" width="300" height="300" class = "imagemargin">
      <br>
      <p class = "floatleft">
        Iridescent
      </p>
