      <h2>Don't Break Them!</h2>
      <p>
        The number one tip when it comes to growing you nails is obvious: do not break them. There are many daily activities that put you nails in danger, like exposure to water, opening things (doors, packages, soda cans, etc.), and simply bumping into things. While growing your nails out, just be careful to avoid anything that you think may put your nails in danger of breaking, or at least be careful while you do these things. To protect your nails from breaking, I would suggest using nail oil.

      <h2>Nail Oil & Making Your Own</h2>
      <p>
        Nail Oil helps to prevent your nails from breaking. Apply it 3-6 times daily to cuticles and massage in.

        There are many companies that produce great nail oil, but you can make your own to customize it to your needs. The one most essential ingredient  of nail oil is an oil called jojoba oil. Here's where it gets science-y. The molecular structure of jojoba oil is most similar to the substance that your body naturally produces to nurture your nails. When we expose our nails to substances like rubbing alcohol, acetone, and even water, we can dry out our nails and remove most of that naturally-occuring substance from them. Applying jojoba oil to our nails multiple times daily can replace that substance and keep our nails healthy. Plus, it makes our cuticles nice and soft. The way that nail oil helps to reduce the risk of breaking nails is by making the nail much more flexible and less brittle. If the nail is flexible and is, for example, hit against something, it will not break, but instead bend, so that you can keep growing you nails without starting over.
